### Chapter 3 Lab Instructions

## Question 1, Length of Name

Finish the function to check if a name is longer or shorter than 6 letters. 


## Question 2, Shout!

Finish the function to 'shout' a name. The function should return 
 the name in uppercase, with three exclamation points at the end. 
 
For example, if the name is 'Beyonce', your function should return 'BEYONCE!!!'


## Question 3, Which number is larger?

Finish the function to compare two numbers.

If the two numbers are the same, return the string 'same'.
If the first number is larger than the second, return the string 'first'
If the second number if larger than the first, return the string 'second'.

For example, when calling the which_number_is_larger function with 3 and 3, it should return 'same'
When calling the which_number_is_larger function with 10 and 6, it should return 'first'
When calling the which_number_is_larger function with 9 and 100, it should return 'second'


## Question 4, Rectangle Area 

For this question, you need to write the function. 
The function must be called rectangle_area.
It will take two parameters, the height and width of a rectangle
It will return the area of the rectangle (tip: calculate by multiplying height and width, for example, a rectangle with height = 3 and width = 3 has an area of 3*2 = 6.

In your main function, call your new rectangle_area function. Use the value rectangle_area returns to print the area for the user.
