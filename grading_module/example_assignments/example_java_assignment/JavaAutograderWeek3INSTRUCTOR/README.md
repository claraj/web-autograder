# Lab 3, Methods 

## Instructions:

Read the instructions, and finish the code, usually marked with //TODO messages. 

Run your code to make sure it works. Also run the tests, and make sure the Autograder will think it works too.

When done, commit and push your code to your own GitHub repository.

The Autograder will check your code after the lab deadline.  

If any of the tests fail and you are sure your code is right, please tell me ASAP! 
These are new and there may be bugs in the tests. Your help and feedback is appreciated.

Any questions? Problems? Concerns? **Please let me know!**. I'm here to help.
